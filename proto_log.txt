    dig challenge, dissatisfaction with architecture
    
    ok well oof.
    
    i think my plan to keep moving forward is to just move everything
    into a new folder named old, and start fresh with a reference.
    
    i believe this is the right move, but theres a nagging feeling
    im just too scared to work with old code.
    
    On a positive note, I'd also like to try out Test Driven Development.
    It sounds super sick, and works for this game.

    Whatever AI stuff I did last commit.
    
    I don't want to rewrite, but I want to make heavy changes.
    I can kinda shove them in and hope for the best.
    So, this is the commit to revert to when things blow up.

    Crude AI. (Playtest-able demo?)
    
    The AI just sorts each row. Theres also some hacky code that makes the sorter
    flatten the top, if its working in that area.
    I'll send it out for testing, even though its not a hard challenge for me.
